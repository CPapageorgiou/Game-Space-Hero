# Space Hero
Game (2d) developed in Unity in the context of a module at university. Worked in a team with eight membes following the Scrum framework, having the role of a developer. 

The game is located in space with the player being an astronaut. It consists of five scenes:
<ul>
<li><strong> Galaxy: </strong> The game starts from here. It contains the background story of the game and the player needs to move to Mars to begin fighting the enemies. </li>
<li> <strong> Mars: </strong> The first scene where the player fights the enemies.</li>
<li> <strong> Venus: </strong> More intricate scene with a larger number of enemies and less recources compared to mars.</li>
<li> <strong> Space Station: </strong> A scene with no enemies but a lot of recourses such as bullets and grenades.</li>
<li> <strong> Final scene: </strong> The final scene of the game with the boss enemy. If the boss is defeated the game ends. </li>
</ul>
